# ✅ What the Code Does
This Java program:
1.Creates an integer array
2.Sorts the array in ascending order
3.Prints the sorted values

# 📌 Line-by-Line Explanation
int[] nums = { 5, 3, 8, 1, 2 };
- You created an integer array named nums.
- It contains 5 numbers: 5, 3, 8, 1, 2.

# Arrays.sort(nums);
- Arrays.sort() is a built-in Java method.
- It sorts the array in ascending order.
- After sorting, the array becomes:
```
1 2 3 5 8
```
# for (int n : nums) { ... }
- This is an enhanced for loop (for-each loop).
- It takes each number n from the array nums one by one.
- Then prints it with a space.

# 📤 Final Output
```
1 2 3 5 8
```
